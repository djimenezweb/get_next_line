Wiktionary has grown beyond a standard dictionary
and now includes a thesaurus,
a rhyme guide,
phrase books, 
language statistics 
and extensive appendices.

We
aim to include not only the definition of a word,
but also enough information to really understand it.

Thus etymologies,

pronunciations,

sample quotations,

synonyms,


antonyms

and


translations are included
